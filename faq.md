## What is quantum computing, and why is it important for the physical sciences?


## Am I eligible to participate in the hackathon?

Yes! The hackathon is open to everyone, regardless of background or experience. We encourage participants from all career stages, including students, researchers, and professionals, to join us. For code-based projects, we recommend at least beginner Python programming experience[<sup>(?)</sup>][faq]{:title="Do I need to use Python, or can I use other languages?"} and basic familiarity with git and GitHub. Prior to the hackathon, we also recommend that participants study the basic concepts behind Bayesian optimization. For those looking to learn or refresh their knowledge on these topics, please study the items provided in the [resources page](_/../resources.md).


## Are there specific packages I should use?

This is a BYOP ("bring-your-own-package") event. We have some recommendations for newcomers, but we hope to see a diverse set of solutions applied to the benchmark tasks. Likewise, multiple teams using the same package is not a problem, since solutions can remain private during the course of the hackathon.


## Do I need to use Python, or can I use other languages?

We recommend using Python, as it is the most common language for scientific computing and has a wide range of libraries with respect to quantum computing. However, you are welcome to use other languages if you prefer.


## Does it have to be quantum computing or quantum-inspired computing, or are other algorithms allowed?

Yes, there needs to be some sub-algorithm or connected algorithm which makes use of a quantum computing based method or quantum-inspired method to enhance a model or calculation pipeline.


## Is the challenge a competition?

Yes, in some sense. You will work in a team to accomplish ...
Submissions will be reviewed by a team of judges[<sup>(?)</sup>][faq]{:title="What is expected from me if I act as a judge?"}, and top-ranked projects will receive prizes sponsored by [Matterhorn Studio](https://matterhorn.studio/).


## Do I need to have a team to participate?

Yes, it is a condition to form a team of a minimum of three members with one member having an academic affiliation.
This will allow you to share ideas and learn from others! It is up to you to identify and form a team, and you can do so at any time leading up to the phase 1 challenge submission.


## Can I participate in multiple projects?

Yes, you may participate in multiple projects. For example, one may wish to apply a particular algorithm to a benchmark *and* create a concept-focused instructional tutorial to accompany it. Each of these would be considered a separate project with its own template. However, we encourage participants to be realistic about the limited time available during the challenge as well as communicate this to other team members if participating in multiple projects.


## Does my GitHub repository need to be public?

During the course of the hackathon, your repository can remain private. However, to be considered for phase 2 and the final winners evaluation, your repository must be made public together with a pull request to the Quantum-Challenge-2025 repository.
This ensures that the work is accessible to the community and can be reviewed by the judges[<sup>(?)</sup>][faq]{:title="What is expected from me if I act as a judge?"} during the [judging and showcase section](_/../agenda.md). You are also welcome to make your repository public at any time leading up to or during the challenge.


## How do I prepare for the project showcase?

You will receive further information when your team has been selected as one of the winner teams to present at a selected conference.
